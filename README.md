# Facial-Emotion-Detection_SRI
This project is part of my Summer Reseach Internship on the same.
This repository contains a python notebook and other files dedicated to detecting facial emotions from images downloaded both from net and in real-time using webcam.
I am using FER2013 dataset for this and you can download the dataset from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y0SBs5o_MggFw34UHQEzzN7lLBIzdcuf/view?usp=sharing

Download all the files and open the notebook in google colab and upload all the other files there. Run the codes block by block and get the results for the same.
Thank You.
